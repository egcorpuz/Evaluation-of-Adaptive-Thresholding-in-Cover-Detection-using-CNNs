# Evaluation of Adaptive Thresholding in Detecting Cover Pairs using Song-to-Song Cross-Similarity Matrix with Convolutional Neural Networks
An undergraduate student project by Christian Craig and Gian Corpuz

For the Preprocessing stage, we used Linux terminal with installed Eseentia library and Python and Go packages.

In the training stage, for ConvNet-1 and ConvNet-2, we used TensorFlow and TensorFlow GPU 2.0.0 and Keras and Keras GPU 2.2.4.
For the ResNet models, we used TensorFlow and Keras 2.7.

For the testing part, we used TF 2.0 and Keras 2.2.4 for all models.
